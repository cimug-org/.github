## The CIMug Open Source Initiative

This CIM Users Group GitHub Organization serves as the official GitHub site for open source projects sponsored by the CIM Users Group (CIMug). It is the companion site to CIMug’s primary community site ([https://cimug.ucaiug.org/](https://cimug.ucaiug.org/)).

The CIMug Open Source Initiative is dedicated to providing open source projects and tooling that benefit the CIM community at large with commercially friendly licenses. Our gaol is to:

- Provide awareness of CIM open source projects and tooling
- Promote open source projects that help advance CIM and CIM related standards
- Provide a central repository for CIM related open source projects and tooling
- Provide a space for promoting collaboration around these projects within the CIM community

## CIM Users Group

### Our Mission

The **CIM Users Group (CIMug)** ([https://cimug.ucaiug.org/](https://cimug.ucaiug.org/)) is dedicated to managing and communicating issues concerning the TC57 IEC 61970 and 61968 standards and to serving as the primary means for developing consensus and consistency across the industry.

### About CIM Users Group

The CIM Users Group was formed in 2005, as a subgroup of the UCA International Users Group, to provide a forum in which users, consultants, and suppliers could cooperate and leverage the IEC CIM International Standards to advance interoperability across the utility enterprise. The primary purpose is to share technology basics, best practices and technical resources while Advancing Interoperability for the Utility Enterprise.

### What is the CIM and why is it needed?​

The Common Information Model (CIM) is an abstract information model that provides data understanding through the identification of the relationships and associations of the data within a utility enterprise. This enhanced data understanding supports the exchange of data models and messages and increases the ability to integrate applications both within the enterprise and with trading partners. These trends go beyond exchange or updates of network models to the exchange of specific dynamic data within transactional messages in a real-time environment.

The CIM companion standards provide extensions and specifications that, when used in conjunction with the CIM models, provide a framework for the exchange of static models, transactional messages and full enterprise integration.
