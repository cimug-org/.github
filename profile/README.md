## The UCA Users Groups Open Source Initiative

This UCA Users Group GitHub Organization serves as the official GitHub site for open source projects sponsored by the UCA and its associated Users Groups. This site serves as the companion site to the following UCA Users Group communities:

- [UCA CIM Users Group](https://cimug.org/)
- [UCA 61850 Users Group](https://61850ug.org/)
  
The **UCA Users Groups Open Source Initiative** is dedicated to providing open source projects and tooling that benefit the CIM and 61850 communities with commercially friendly licenses. Our goal is to:

- Provide awareness of CIM and61850 open source projects and tooling
- Promote open source projects that help advance CIM and CIM related standards
- Provide a central Repository for CIM and 61850 related open source projects and tooling
- Provide a centralized place for promoting collaboration around these projects within the UCA CIM and 61850 Users Group communities

To inquire about the UCA CIM and 61850 Users Groups Open Source Initiative or to discuss contributing new projects to the initiative please contact us at [github.admin@cimug.org](mailto:github.admin@cimug.org?subject=UCA-Open-Source-Initiatives)

## The Missions of the CIM and 61850 Users Group Communities

### 61850 Users Group

The UCA 61850 Users Group is dedicated to fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing among professionals involved in implementing, advancing the adoption, and testing of 61850 and its associated standards. The open source projects hosted and maintained here are made available for the benefit of the broader 61850 user community.

### CIM Users Group

The **CIM Users Group (CIMug)** ([https://cimug.ucaiug.org/](https://cimug.ucaiug.org/)) is dedicated to managing and communicating issues concerning the TC57 IEC 61970 and 61968 standards and to serving as the primary means for developing consensus and consistency across the industry. It was formed in 2005, as a subgroup of the UCA International Users Group, to provide a forum in which users, consultants, and suppliers could cooperate and leverage the IEC CIM International Standards to advance interoperability across the utility enterprise. The primary purpose is to share technology basics, best practices and technical resources while Advancing Interoperability for the Utility Enterprise.

#### What is the CIM and why is it needed?​

The Common Information Model (CIM) is an abstract information model that provides data understanding through the identification of the relationships and associations of the data within a utility enterprise. This enhanced data understanding supports the exchange of data models and messages and increases the ability to integrate applications both within the enterprise and with trading partners. These trends go beyond exchange or updates of network models to the exchange of specific dynamic data within transactional messages in a real-time environment.

The CIM companion standards provide extensions and specifications that, when used in conjunction with the CIM models, provide a framework for the exchange of static models, transactional messages and full enterprise integration.
