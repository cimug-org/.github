## CIM Users Group

### Our Mission

The **CIM Users Group (CIMug)** ([https://cimug.ucaiug.org/](https://cimug.ucaiug.org/)) is dedicated to managing and communicating issues concerning the TC57 IEC 61970 and 61968 standards and to serving as the primary means for developing consensus and consistency across the industry.

### About CIM Users Group

The CIM Users Group was formed in 2005, as a subgroup of the UCA International Users Group, to provide a forum in which users, consultants, and suppliers could cooperate and leverage the IEC CIM International Standards to advance interoperability across the utility enterprise. The primary purpose is to share technology basics, best practices and technical resources while Advancing Interoperability for the Utility Enterprise.

### What is the CIM and why is it needed?​

The Common Information Model (CIM) is an abstract information model that provides data understanding through the identification of the relationships and associations of the data within a utility enterprise. This enhanced data understanding supports the exchange of data models and messages and increases the ability to integrate applications both within the enterprise and with trading partners. These trends go beyond exchange or updates of network models to the exchange of specific dynamic data within transactional messages in a real-time environment.

The CIM companion standards provide extensions and specifications that, when used in conjunction with the CIM models, provide a framework for the exchange of static models, transactional messages and full enterprise integration.
